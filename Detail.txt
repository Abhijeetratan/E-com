1. npm init => install package.json

2. npm i express dotenv mongoose --save
                     => Install express dotenv and moongoose

3. npm i nodemon --save-dev
                     => Install nodemon 

4. Devlopment Mode => This mode is designed for developers during the development and 
                      testing phases of the software lifecycle.

5. Production Mode => This mode is intended for the final deployment of the application 
                      in a live, user-facing environment.
                      
6. ProductControllers => Add logic for end point

   Req => req is an object that represents the HTTP request from the client to the server.

   Res => res is an object that represents the HTTP response that the server will send back
          to the client.

   Next => next is a function that is passed to middleware functions and route handlers.      
           If next is not called, the request-response cycle can be terminated, and no 
           further middleware or route handlers will be executed.

    .Pagination => Pagination is a common technique used in web development to break down a
                large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks or pages. In the 
                context of a React application, you can implement pagination to display
                a limited number of items on each page and allow users to navigate through
                the data.

7.Bcrypt => npm install bcrypt
              Use of bcrypt=>
              1. Bcrypt is a widely used library for hashing passwords in a secure and efficient manner. 
              2. Basically is is use to save data in format that can not be shown directly.
         => Salt Generation
              Use of Salt Generation
              1. A unique random salt is generated for each password. The salt is then combined with the
                 password before hashing.        
              2. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed passwords will 
                 differ due to the unique salts.               
         => Asynchronous Nature
              1. The hashing and comparison functions are asynchronous, making them suitable for
                 handling potentially time-consuming tasks without blocking the event loop.  

8.Jwttoken => npm install jsonwebtoken
         => JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties.
         => They are often used for authentication and authorization purposes in web development.

9.Nodemailer => npm install nodemailer
         => Nodemailer is a popular module for Node.js that allows you to send emails easily.

10.CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)=> npm install cors
         => It's a crucial mechanism for protecting user data and preventing malicious attacks like
            Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

==> React => npx create-react-app .
          => React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications.
          => It was developed by Facebook and open-sourced in 2013. 
          => React is widely used because of its simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility.

   => Component-Based Architecture =>
          => React is based on a component-based architecture, where UIs are composed of reusable and
             independent components.
          => Each component represents a part of the user interface and encapsulates its own logic, 
             state, and structure.    
   => Virtual DOM
